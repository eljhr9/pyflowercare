# Contributing to FlowerCare Python Library

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the FlowerCare Python Library! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally
3. **Set up development environment**
4. **Make your changes**
5. **Run tests** and ensure they pass
6. **Submit a pull request**

## üîß Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+** (3.10 or 3.11 recommended)
- **Poetry** for dependency management
- **Git** for version control
- **FlowerCare device** for testing (optional but recommended)

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pyflowercare.git
cd pyflowercare

# Install Poetry if you haven't already
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

# Install dependencies (including development dependencies)
poetry install --with dev,docs

# Install pre-commit hooks
poetry run pre-commit install

# Verify installation
poetry run pytest --version
poetry run black --version
```

### Development Environment

The project uses several tools for code quality:

- **Black**: Code formatting
- **isort**: Import sorting
- **mypy**: Type checking
- **pytest**: Testing framework
- **pre-commit**: Git hooks for code quality

## üìù Making Changes

### Code Style

The project follows these coding standards:

1. **PEP 8** compliance (enforced by Black)
2. **Type hints** for all public functions
3. **Docstrings** in Google style
4. **Import sorting** with isort
5. **Line length**: 88 characters (Black default)

Example function:
```python
async def read_sensor_data(self, retries: int = 3) -> SensorData:
    """Read current sensor measurements from the device.
    
    Args:
        retries: Number of retry attempts on failure
        
    Returns:
        SensorData object containing current measurements
        
    Raises:
        ConnectionError: If device connection fails
        DeviceError: If device operation fails
        DataParsingError: If sensor data is invalid
    """
    # Implementation here
```

### Testing

Write tests for all new functionality:

```bash
# Run all tests
poetry run pytest

# Run tests with coverage
poetry run pytest --cov=flowercare

# Run specific test file
poetry run pytest tests/test_device.py

# Run tests matching pattern
poetry run pytest -k "test_connection"
```

### Type Checking

Ensure type hints are correct:

```bash
# Run mypy type checking
poetry run mypy flowercare/

# Check specific file
poetry run mypy flowercare/device.py
```

### Documentation

Update documentation for any public API changes:

```bash
# Build documentation locally
poetry run mkdocs serve

# Build static documentation
poetry run mkdocs build
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure

Tests are organized in the `tests/` directory:

```
tests/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_device.py          # Device class tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_scanner.py         # Scanner class tests  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_models.py          # Data model tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_exceptions.py      # Exception handling tests
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ conftest.py            # Pytest configuration
```

### Writing Tests

1. **Use descriptive test names**:
```python
def test_device_connects_successfully_with_valid_mac():
    pass

def test_scanner_finds_devices_within_timeout():
    pass
```

2. **Test both success and failure cases**:
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_device_read_data_success():
    # Test successful data reading
    pass

@pytest.mark.asyncio  
async def test_device_read_data_connection_error():
    # Test connection failure handling
    pass
```

3. **Use fixtures for common setup**:
```python
@pytest.fixture
async def mock_device():
    """Create a mock FlowerCare device for testing."""
    device = Mock()
    device.mac_address = "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"
    device.name = "Test Device"
    return device
```

### Async Testing

Use `pytest-asyncio` for async tests:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_async_function():
    result = await some_async_function()
    assert result == expected_value
```

### Mocking Bluetooth

For tests that don't require real hardware:

```python
from unittest.mock import Mock, AsyncMock, patch

@patch('flowercare.device.BleakClient')
async def test_device_without_hardware(mock_bleak):
    mock_client = AsyncMock()
    mock_bleak.return_value = mock_client
    
    # Test your code here
```

## üì¶ Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

2. **Check code quality**:
```bash
poetry run black flowercare/ tests/
poetry run isort flowercare/ tests/

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development Tips

### Local Testing with Real Devices

```python
# Create test configuration
TEST_DEVICE_MAC = "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"  # Your device MAC

async def test_with_real_device():
    scanner = FlowerCareScanner() 
    device = await scanner.find_device_by_mac(TEST_DEVICE_MAC)
    
    if device:
        async with device:
            data = await device.read_sensor_data()
            print(f"Test data: {data}")
    else:
        print("Test device not found")
```

### Debugging Bluetooth Issues

```python
# Enable debug logging
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Use this for debugging
from flowercare.logging import setup_logging
setup_logging("DEBUG")
```

### Performance Testing

```python
import time

async def performance_test(device):
    start_time = time.time()
    
    async with device:
        data = await device.read_sensor_data()
    
    elapsed = time.time() - start_time
    print(f"Read took {elapsed:.2f} seconds")
```
